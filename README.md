# bitris

Rust crate for Tetris research, the board is defined by bits. it means that bitris has no colors. instead, it runs faster and with less memory.

This repository is still in the alpha version. Therefore, the interface is still unstable.

The current goal is to reimplement some commands from https://github.com/knewjade/solution-finder in Rust.
We plan to integrate some components created in the process.


# Usage/Documents

Now you can refer to the `cargo doc` and some examples.

The examples are like a startup guide and exhaustive.
Then, when more detail is needed, we recommend generating crate documentation.

Eventually, when crate documentation is available on the web, we plan to organize it.
